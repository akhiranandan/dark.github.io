    <p3>The casting is one major gem that surprised me alot, the casting director deserves an oscar for selection of such perfect people chosen to play their older selves.I mean pick any character and see their old selves, how similar they look as if they are the real older ones. All in all, the casting deserves a whole lot of praise - it meant they didn't just have to stick to gimmicky hairstyles for viewers to remember who was who. Obviously, the credit goes to Simone BÃ¤r, the casting director who managed these uncanny doppelgangers. Thanks for making an already great show that much more amazing!<br><br>

        Dark is different from any other Time-travel movie or series it takes time as an element which nothing has used before like it. the creators did a excellent job of storytelling and keeping the plot together and shocking us every episode. The plot of the series is quite complicated but if you have watched it entirely then to there will be some details that you have missed .Its one of the rare series that makes you completely lose your mind and doesnot let to stop thinking about the things you saw all in all the show lacks some humour as there are many adult plot points invloved but not to say as the show lives upto its name as its dark in many ways.The creators decided to make a trilogy but as it is after the end of the 2nd season there are many burning questions left which the fans need to get answers but till then the first two seasons are worth watching. personally i would recommend to watch it in its original german version but will say that the english dub is good you can go for it if subtitles are not your thing or you don't know german. This show takes time travel to a new dimension and explores in a unique and bold way which will keep you coming for more.
